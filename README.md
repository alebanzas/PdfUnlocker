# PdfUnlocker

Unlocks all PDF files in a given folder. It uses the ["PDFCreator"](https://www.pdfforge.org/pdfcreator/download) printer, configured with a "auto" profile.

I have tested it only in Windows 10. 

Feel free to contribute. The error handling is not something I am proud of :)

Happy unlocking!
